abstract: Little is known about the detection of and preference for multiple simultaneous
  parallel axes of symmetry. Neuroscientists have suggested that the detection of
  symmetry occurs in extrastriate brain areas with large receptive fields. Such large
  receptive fields may potentially hinder the simultaneous detection of more than
  one axis of symmetry. In contrast, psychophysicists have found that symmetry detection
  occurs within small spatial windows, allowing for the concurrent detection of multiple
  axes of symmetry. Using psychophysical and computational methods, we aim to test
  whether multiple axes of symmetry can be detected in parallel and to understand
  the role of multiple axes of symmetry on aesthetic valence. Experiment 1 provides
  evidence that multiple axes of symmetry cannot be detected simultaneously. However,
  with relatively long temporal integration, people can detect them. Experiment 2
  suggests that multiple axes of symmetry tend to increase preference. However, the
  preference for symmetry is not universal because, although most people prefer symmetry,
  others prefer complex images without axes of symmetry. We present and test a computational
  model that explains the results of these experiments.
