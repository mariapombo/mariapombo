 abstract = {Online methods allow testing of larger, more diverse populations, with much less effort than in-lab testing. However, many psychophysical measurements, including visual crowding, require accurate eye fixation, which is classically achieved by testing only experienced observers who have learned to fixate reliably, or by using a gaze tracker to restrict testing to moments when fixation is accurate. Alas, both approaches are impractical online since online observers tend to be inexperienced, and online gaze tracking, using the built-in webcam, has a low precision (4 deg, Papoutsaki et al., 2016). The EasyEyes open-source software reliably measures peripheral thresholds online with accurate fixation achieved in a novel way, without gaze tracking. EasyEyes tells observers to use the cursor to track a moving crosshair. At a random time during successful tracking, a brief target is presented in the periphery. The observer responds by identifying the target. To evaluate EasyEyes fixation accuracy and thresholds, we tested 12 naive observers in three ways in a counterbalanced order: first, in the lab, using gaze-contingent stimulus presentation (Kurzawski et al., 2023; Pelli et al., 2016); second, in the lab, using EasyEyes while independently monitoring gaze; third, online at home, using EasyEyes. We find that crowding thresholds are consistent (no significant differences in mean and variance of thresholds across ways) and individual differences are conserved. The small root mean square (RMS) fixation error (0.6 deg) during target presentation eliminates the need for gaze tracking. Thus, EasyEyes enables fixation-dependent measurements online, for easy testing of larger and more diverse populations.},
