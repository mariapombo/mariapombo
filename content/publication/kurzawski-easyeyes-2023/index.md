abstract: 'Online methods allow testing of larger, more diverse populations, with
  much less effort than in-lab testing. However, many psychophysical measurements,
  including visual crowding, require accurate eye fixation, which is classically achieved
  by testing only experienced observers who have learned to fixate reliably, or by
  using a gaze tracker to restrict testing to moments when fixation is accurate. Alas,
  both approaches are impractical online since online observers tend to be inexperienced,
  and online gaze tracking, using the built-in webcam, has a low precision (4 deg,
  Papoutsaki et al., 2016). The EasyEyes open-source software reliably measures peripheral
  thresholds online with accurate fixation achieved in a novel way, without gaze tracking.
  EasyEyes tells observers to use the cursor to track a moving crosshair. At a random
  time during successful tracking, a brief target is presented in the periphery. The
  observer responds by identifying the target. To evaluate EasyEyes fixation accuracy
  and thresholds, we tested 12 naive observers in three ways in a counterbalanced
  order: first, in the lab, using gaze-contingent stimulus presentation (Kurzawski
  et al., 2023; Pelli et al., 2016); second, in the lab, using EasyEyes while independently
  monitoring gaze; third, online at home, using EasyEyes. We find that crowding thresholds
  are consistent (no significant differences in mean and variance of thresholds across
  ways) and individual differences are conserved. The small root mean square (RMS)
  fixation error (0.6 deg) during target presentation eliminates the need for gaze
  tracking. Thus, EasyEyes enables fixation-dependent measurements online, for easy
  testing of larger and more diverse populations.'
