abstract: Recall memory and sequential dependence threaten the independence of successive
  beauty ratings. Such independence is usually assumed when using repeated measures
  to estimate the intrinsic variance of a rating. We call “intrinsic” the variance
  of all possible responses that the participant could give on a trial. Variance arises
  within and across participants. In attributing the measured variance to sources,
  the first step is to assess how much is intrinsic. In seven experiments, we measure
  how much of the variability across beauty ratings can be attributed to recall memory
  and sequential dependence. With a set size of one, memory is a problem and contributes
  half the measured variance. However, we showed that for both beauty and ellipticity,
  with set size of nine or more, recall memory causes a mere 10% increase in the variance
  of repeated ratings. Moreover, we showed that as long as the stimuli are diverse
  (i.e., represent different object categories), sequential dependence does not affect
  the variance of beauty ratings. Lastly, the variance of beauty ratings increases
  in proportion to the 0.15 power of stimulus set size. We show that the beauty rating
  of a stimulus in a diverse set is affected by the stimulus set size and not the
  value of other stimuli. Overall, we conclude that the variance of repeated ratings
  is a good way to estimate the intrinsic variance of a beauty rating of a stimulus
  in a diverse set.
