abstract: When do aesthetic properties convey the concept of premiumness? Is symmetry
  tied to the perception of premiumness due to symmetry's evolutionary association
  to quality, an association not present with other aesthetic features like curvature?
  Usually, symmetry and curvature are preferred features. However, preference itself
  may not suffice to evoke premiumness. With this in mind, we predicted that symmetry
  (vs. asymmetry) and high (vs. low) product quality would both increase the perception
  of premiumness of a product while curvature (curved vs. angular) would only do so
  when it aligned with product quality. We conducted two preliminary exploratory experiments
  and four preregistered experiments in which we manipulated product quality, symmetry,
  and curvature of product packaging and measured preference and premiumness perception.
  We also conducted four additional experiments using a different product category
  to assess the generalizability of our results. We found that while both symmetry
  and curvature affect preference, only symmetry affects premiumness perception. Importantly,
  our results indicate that the extent to which aesthetic features convey brand premiumness
  can be product-specific. We suggest a theoretical model on when visual aesthetic
  properties convey premiumness. Overall, our study informs how subtle aesthetic elements
  play a role in value perception, something which firms can capitalize on.
