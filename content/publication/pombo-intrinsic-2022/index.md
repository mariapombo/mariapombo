abstract: The intrinsic variance of a beauty rating is the essential baseline for
  evaluating how beauty ratings vary within and across individuals. Given independent
  repeated measures, it’s easy to estimate the variance of the distribution underlying
  one judgment. However, in the context of beauty, effects of assimilation, contrast,
  and recall-memory might produce sequential dependence, spoiling the independence.
  In seven experiments, we measure how much of the variability across beauty ratings
  can be attributed to recall memory and sequential dependence. We find that recall
  memory contributes little to the variability of repeated judgment (less than 0.7
  standard deviation on a 7-point Likert scale) for both subjective beauty ratings
  and an ellipticity judgment with ground truth. We also find that order effects,
  including assimilation and contrast, become measurable only when the stimuli are
  very similar, regardless of task. Lastly, we find that, after discounting the small
  recall-memory contribution, the intrinsic variance of beauty judgment increases
  slightly with stimulus set size. Our results indicate that the response to a given
  stimulus in a diverse set is affected by the number and not the value of other stimuli,
  which parallels Miller’s (1956) 7±2 limit on one-dimensional perceptual categorization.
  Overall, we show that, provided the stimuli are not very similar, recall memory
  and sequential dependence hardly affect the intrinsic variability of beauty judgment.
  Hence, the variance of repeated ratings does estimate the intrinsic variance of
  beauty judgment of one stimulus in a diverse set.
